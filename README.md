# Live demo : http://subform.svelteapp.surge.sh/

## Get started

Install the dependencies and start...

```bash
cd svelte-subscription
npm install
npm run dev

By default, the server will only respond to requests from localhost. To allow connections from other computers, edit the `sirv` commands in package.json to include the option `--host 0.0.0.0`.

## Building and running in production mode

To create an optimised version of the app:

```bash
npm run build
```

## Deployment

Once the changes are merged to `main`, the changes are deployed by set github actions.
